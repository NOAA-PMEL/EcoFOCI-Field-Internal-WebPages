## Bundles

Two Bundles exist for this package:
1. This repository (clone it and then copy into local "web" directory
2. Bundle with database connectors, static media, dynamic file structure (for autogenerated content), and library dependencies.  The goal is to minimize this bundle to the point that it is just database connectors (always remain offline), and static media (videos, pics, etc).  Unpack this into the "web" directory
